# Software Licensing Process using OpenSSL in C/C++

This document details the steps for generating and verifying a software license in C/C++ using the OpenSSL library. The license is based on the device's MAC address, which is hashed and then signed with a private key. The signature is verified using the corresponding public key during software usage.

## 1. Retrieve MAC Address

The first step involves obtaining the MAC address of the user's device.

### Steps:
- Identify the network interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- Retrieve the MAC address using system-specific APIs or commands.
- Format and store the MAC address for further processing.

### Example Code Snippet:
```cpp
// C/C++ code to retrieve and format MAC address (platform-specific)
```

## 2. Generate License

After obtaining the MAC address, generate a unique software license.

### Steps:
- **Hash the MAC Address**: Use OpenSSL to hash the MAC address.
  
  ```cpp
  // Include OpenSSL headers
  #include <openssl/sha.h>

  // Function to hash MAC address using SHA-256
  void hash_mac_address(const char* mac, unsigned char* outputHash) {
      SHA256_CTX sha256;
      SHA256_Init(&sha256);
      SHA256_Update(&sha256, mac, strlen(mac));
      SHA256_Final(outputHash, &sha256);
  }

```

## 3. Use of License

Verifying the software license during usage is crucial for security.
**Steps**:

    Verify the Signature with Public Key: Use OpenSSL to verify the signature with the corresponding public key.

```code
// Include OpenSSL headers
#include <openssl/rsa.h>
#include <openssl/pem.h>

// Function to verify the signature with a public key
int verify_signature(const unsigned char* signature, unsigned int sig_len, const unsigned char* hash, size_t hash_len, const char* keyfile) {
    FILE* fp = fopen(keyfile, "r");
    RSA* rsa = PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY(fp, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    fclose(fp);

    return RSA_verify(NID_sha256, hash, hash_len, signature, sig_len, rsa);
}

```
**License Verification**: Check if the signature is valid. If valid, the software is licensed for use.

## Conclusion

This process, utilizing the MAC address, OpenSSL, and C/C++ programming, ensures that each software installation is uniquely licensed to a specific device. This enhances security and helps prevent unauthorized usage.

Please replace the placeholder comments and code snippets with your actual implementation. This template assumes the use of SHA-256 for hashing and RSA for signing, which are common choices, but you should adjust these details according to your specific requirements and the version of OpenSSL you are using.
